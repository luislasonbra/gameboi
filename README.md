#GameBoi

####About
NOTE: Progress has been abandoned in favor of pyboi
This is a gameboy emulator written in java. It is currently
under development.

####Status
The emulator passes Blargg's cpu instruction test and
emulates most games successfully. The cpu z80 emulation
is solid and the lcd emulation works well. Saving has yet to be implemented.
The memory access timing and instruction timing are both not 100% accurate.
These arent really necessary for functionality, so if I get a chance I'll
fix that.
