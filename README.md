# GameBoi

#### About
This is a gameboy emulator written in java. It is currently
under development

#### Status
The emulator passes Blargg's cpu instruction test and
emulates some games successfully. The cpu 'z80' emulation
is solid and the lcd emulation works well. Saving has yet to be implemented.
The memory access timing and instruction timing are both not very accurate.
