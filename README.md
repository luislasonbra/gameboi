#GameBoi

####About

This is a gameboy emulator written in java, and is currently
under development.

####Status
The emulator passes Blargg's cpu instruction test, and
emulates a couple games successfully. The cpu z80 emulation
is solid, and graphics work decently well. Things like saving
and sound have yet to be implemented. The memory access timing and
instruction timing are both still not 100% accurate. Gameboi doesn't pass blargg's tests for these situations.
